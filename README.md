# Snake Game

<img src="Screenshot.png" alt="snake image" />

This is a simple snake game built with Next.js and TypeScript. The game is built with a 12x12 grid and the snake moves in four directions: up, down, left, and right. The snake grows in size when it eats the food and the game is over when the snake collides with itself. The snake speed increases as the snake grows in size.
and the score is calculated based on the number of food eaten by the snake.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
